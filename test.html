<dl><dt>Opposition must move forward with common minimum programme: Bihar Congress chief</dt><dd>PATNA: The issue of who would be the prime ministerial face of the opposition alliance is not important as the leadership question can be tackled collectively after dislodging the BJP-RSS from power, Bihar Congress chief Akhilesh Prasad Singh said on Thursday, stressing the need for preparing a common minimum programme soon.Singh claimed that when opposition parties unite and contest the general elections next year, the BJP will come down to less than 100 seats.His remarks come ahead of a crucial meeting on Friday of top leaders of opposition parties to chart a roadmap for the formation of an anti-BJP front for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.In an interview with PTI, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Singh said his party is the central pillar of opposition unity and stressed that small differences between parties will be ironed out at meetings such as the one taking place here."We hope that all will sit together and an amicable solution will be reached to move forward together," Singh said of the opposition meeting.Asked about the BJP's criticism that the opposition does not have a prime ministerial face, he said, "I will take you back to 2004, Manmohan Singh ji was not our prime ministerial face and without a prime ministerial face, with an alliance, the Congress defeated the BJP and when (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji lost, Manmohan Singh ji became the prime minister and continued for 10 years.""This (prime ministerial face) is something not very important, all opposition parties will unite together and contest the election, we are sure the BJP will come down to less than 100," the Rajya Sabha MP said.At present, the Lok Sabha has 543 seats.Stressing that picking the prime ministerial face was not a priority, Singh said it was fine for the BJP to think on those lines but the Congress had not followed that strategy in Karnataka and contested without declaring a CM face.In Himachal Pradesh also, the Congress did not contest declaring a CM face, he pointed out.Asked about voices within the Congress that Rahul Gandhi should be the prime ministerial face, the Bihar Congress chief said, "Whether Rahul ji is the face, he makes someone else the face or someone else becomes the face, all these things probably are not important right now. What is important is how the BJP-RSS is removed from power after that we can pick (the prime ministerial candidate) collectively. I have said that in 2004 Manmohan Singh was not PM face but when Vajpayee ji lost, then people picked him."On the BJP's charge that the opposition alliance was opportunistic as there were serious differences between them, Singh said there were only small issues among opposition parties that would be ironed out."There are small issues â¦ this is not the first meeting, Nitish Kumar ji, Tejashwi Yadav ji have had a meeting with Congress president (Mallikarjun Kharge) and after that everyone is sitting together so these small issues of state politics, the problems that are there with AAP in Delhi and Punjab, there can be some small issues with Mamata di (West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee), for (solving them) we are sitting together," Singh said.All the opposition leaders are mature people with an understanding of politics and they are unanimous over the fact that we need to unite to defeat the divisive politics of the BJP, he asserted.Asked whether the Congress would be the central pillar of the anti-BJP alliance, Singh said Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has said this repeatedly that there is no meaning of an opposition alliance without the Congress."I don't need to say this. All opposition leaders would understand that in terms of national presence, the Congress is there in all states, so how can there be any alliance without the Congress," he said.Pressed further on whether the Congress will be the main pillar of opposition unity, Singh said, "The Congress is (the main pillar) and not will be. Among the Opposition parties, we have governments in three-four states, we have about 800 MLAs nationwide. So, everyone understands this and these things are happening keeping that in mind."On whether the Congress would be the glue that would bind the Opposition, Singh said his party as well as others were working to bring everyone together."The Congress had given Nitish ji the responsibility of speaking with some parties. Also this is not the final meeting, people will keep meeting after that also. It is not as if others won't join in, people will keep coming together and the number of parties will keep increasing," he said.Asserting that issues were more important for the opposition parties, he said a common minimum programme should be prepared."I think we should move forward with a common minimum programme. The BJP will automatically lose," he said, adding that certainly leaders will discuss it.Asked if the common minimum programme would soon evolve, Singh said certainly as the election is just months away.He also asserted that seat sharing for the Lok Sabha polls in Bihar was not an issue."We had fought together earlier also with RJD and the Left â¦ Seat sharing is important but more important is how we come together and fight together to defeat the BJP," he said.Singh also said Patna has been the place for change and has a history. Mahatma Gandhi launched the struggle for Independence from Champaran and we were successful in throwing out the British, he said."I am confident that the bugle of the Modi government's exit will be blown from Bihar," he asserted.Congress president Kharge, former AICC chief Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal chief minister Banerjee, Delhi chief minister and AAP Convener Arvind Kejriwal, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, former chief minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar are among those expected to attend the first high-level opposition meeting being hosted by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and RJD's Yadav.Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and CPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya are the other leaders who have agreed to be part of the meeting.</dd><dt>Hopeful of constructive opposition meeting: Mamata Banerjee</dt><dd>KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee hoped that the opposition meeting in Patna on Friday would be constructive and asserted that the BJP must be defeated in the next Lok Sabha polls to save the country from disaster.Banerjee, who has been critical of the BJP's "mishandling" of the situation in Manipur, said it is due to the policies of the saffron camp that the northeastern state is on the boil and the convening of the all-party meeting on June 24 was a "late decision"."Tomorrow is our opposition meeting. We hope it will be good and collective decisions will be taken. I feel that to save the country from disaster, people will vote against the BJP," she told reporters on Thursday.Top leaders of opposition parties will meet in the Bihar capital to chalk out a roadmap for forming an anti-BJP front for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Asked about the all-party meeting on Manipur convened by Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi on June 24, Banerjee said the Trinamool Congress would be represented by the party's leader in Rajya Sabha, Derek O'Brien."It is too late now. I had requested the Centre to allow me to visit Manipur, but I received a letter yesterday informing me about the all-party meeting," she said.Banerjee said the Centre failed to restore peace in Manipur, where ethnic violence has claimed more than 100 lives.</dd><dt>India-US set to announce deeper cooperation in space, semiconductor and telecommunications tech</dt><dd>NEW DELHI: India and the US are set to announce a host of agreements across several critical sectors that will take relations between the two countries to a "whole new level", said senior officials of the Joe Biden administration on Thursday.See Also: PM Modi US Visit LiveNew consulatesMarking a major improvement and wider diplomatic ties, the US will open two new consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad while India will establish a mission in Seattle to boost people-to-people relationships, a senior White House official said.The US embassy in New Delhi is one of the largest US diplomatic missions in the world.

He was appointed after the Governor approved it. He cannot be removed just at the drop of a hat. The removal process is quite cumbersome, just like removing judges through impeachment,â she said.Her remarks come a day after the Governor âreturnedâ the joining report of Sinha to the state government on Wednesday.

Our F414 engines are unmatched and will offer important economic and national security benefits for both countries as we help our customers produce the highest quality engines to meet the needs of their military fleet,â the US firm said.Currently, HAL uses GE 404 engines for the 83 light combat aircraft it is manufacturing for the IAF.GE Aerospace has operated in India for more than four decades with wide engagement in the industry including engines, avionics, services, engineering, manufacturing, and local sourcing.GE Aerospace's F404 and F414 have been part of the development and production of LCA Mk1 and LCA Mk2 programmes.In total, 75 F404 engines have been delivered and another 99 are on order for LCA Mk1A.Eight F414 engines have been delivered as part of an ongoing development programme for LCA Mk2, the US firm said(With inputs from agencies) </dd><dt>RLD chief  Jayant Chaudhary not to attend opposition meeting in Patna due to pre-decided family programme</dt><dd>LUCKNOW: Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary will skip the opposition leaders' huddle in Patna on Friday due to a family programme but expressed hope the meeting will be an "important milestone in the path of opposition unity".The meeting of opposition parties has been called by Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar to chalk out a joint strategy to take on the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.In a letter to Nitish Kumar that was shared on the official Twitter handle of the RLD on Thursday, Chaudhary said he could not attend the meeting due to a "predetermined family programme"."The way authoritarian and communal forces are posing a threat to democracy and social harmony in the country, it is the need of the hour to unite the opposition parties of the same ideology. By discussing the important problems and challenges of the country, the entire opposition can present a far-reaching, practical plan in front of the public," Chaudhary said in his letter."This way, we can together bring a meaningful change in the country in line with the aspirations of the youth, women, farmers and the underprivileged sections of the society," he said.Extending his best wishes for the success of the meeting, the RLD chief said, "I am sure that this meeting will prove to be an important milestone in the path of opposition unity."Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, party leader Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, her Delhi counterpart and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav, Maharashtra's former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP president Sharad Pawar are among the leaders expected to attend the first high-level opposition meeting.Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati Mayawati has not been invited for the opposition meeting, with JD(U) chief spokesperson K C Tyagi saying "We have invited those parties that are willing to fight against the BJP in 2024"."The BSP says it will not become part of an alliance, then why should we waste our invitation," he told PTI. </dd><dt>G-20 nations can undertake skill mapping at global level, says PM Modi</dt><dd>PUNE: G-20 countries can undertake skill mapping at the global level, find gaps that need to be plugged and also play a key role in promoting research and innovation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday.During a virtual address at the G-20 Education Ministers' meeting in Pune, he stressed the need to strike the right balance between opportunities offered by technology and the challenges posed by it.At the meeting, ministers of the G-20 grouping will formally accept the outcome documents, marking the culmination of the extensive deliberations carried out over the past several months within the education working group track.These outcome documents will serve as a roadmap for the international community, guiding coordinated actions to ensure inclusive and high-quality education for all learners."To make our youth future-ready, we need to continuously skill, re-skill and up-skill them. We need to align their competencies with evolving work profiles and practices. In India, we are undertaking skill mapping. Our education, skill and labour ministries are working in tandem on this initiative. G-20 countries can undertake skill mapping at the global level, and find gaps that need to be plugged."Digital technology serves as an equaliser and promotes inclusivity. It is a force multiplier in increasing access to education. Today artificial intelligence offers great potential in the field of learning, skilling and education. With opportunities, technology also poses challenges. We have to strike the right balance. G-20 can play an important role in this," PM Modi said.The G-20 Education Working Group focused on finding inclusive solutions and collective actions to address the diverse global challenges of the day during its four meetings in Chennai, Amritsar, Bhubaneshwar and Pune.It emphasised on four priority areas -- ensuring foundational literacy and numeracy, especially in the context of blended learning, making tech-enabled learning more inclusive, qualitative, and collaborative; building capacities and promoting lifelong learning in the context of the future of work; and strengthening research and fostering innovation through enhanced collaboration and partnerships."G20 countries can play a key role in promoting research and innovation, especially among the global south.

We have set up 10,000 Atal Tinkering Labs across the country. These are acting as research and innovation nurseries for our school children."More than 7.5 million students are working on more than 1.2 million innovative projects in these labs. G-20 countries, with their respective strengths, can play a key role in promoting research and innovation, especially among the Global South.

PM Modi is on an Official State Visit from June 21-23 at the invitation of President Joe Biden and the First Lady.âThis visit will affirm the deep and close partnership between the US and India and the warm bonds of family and friendship that link Americans and Indians together,â a senior administration official told reporters here.âThe visit will strengthen our two countries' shared commitment to free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific and our shared resolve to elevate our Strategic Technology Partnership, including in defence, clean energy, and space,â the official said.The US, India and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the region.The leaders will discuss ways to further expand the educational exchanges and people-to-people ties, as well as work together to confront common challenges from climate change to workforce development to help security.âAs the world's oldest and largest democracies and key security providers in the Indo-Pacific, the US and India are increasingly partners of the first resort as a combined force for global good both in the Indo-Pacific and elsewhere. India will be a critical strategic partner for the US in the coming decades,â said the official.India's growing commitment to playing a more engaged international role, including in the Indo-Pacific and Quad demonstrates a new and growing willingness to join the US to protect and advance a shared vision of a free, open and rule-based rules-based global order.The Quad or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue comprises India, the US, Japan and Australia.âAs a strong maritime democracy, we work with India, Japan, Australia and other countries in advancing our mutual interest. As we think about the future of AI, quantum computing and building resilient supply chains for clean energy technologies, semiconductors and other critical and emerging technology, countering climate crisis, the future of our workforces, and global health, energy and food security, there is no partner more consequential now and into the future than India,â said the senior White House official.The Biden administration is hosting India for an Official State Visit to put the cooperation on an inexorable trajectory.âAfter years of strengthening ties in a bipartisan context, the US-India partnership is deeper and more expansive than it ever has been. We now...work cooperatively to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific to drive innovation, and to jointly tackle global challenges as the world emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The gap between two full moons is about 29.53 days, so the time span covered by a thousand full moons would be approximately 29,530 days or 80 years and 8 months," a press note said.Modi's gift underscores the traditional respect associated with a person's experience and is significant at a time when President Biden's age is at times a matter of debate, as his country edges towards the next presidential polls.Another gift to Biden is a tribute to the US president's admiration for Irish poet William Butler Yeats.Biden has often quoted poetry from Yeats and made references to his writings and poetry in his public speeches, officials said, adding that Yeats had a deep admiration for India and was greatly influenced by Indian spirituality.His friendship and admiration for Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is well-known and he helped popularise Gurudev's Gitanjali in the Western world, officials said.Yeats' admiration for Indian spirituality was much deeper and he was deeply influenced by the Upanishads and other ancient knowledge streams of India, they said.In 1937, Yeats published an English translation of the Indian Upanishads, co-authored with Shri Purohit Swami. The translation and collaboration between the two authors occurred throughout the 1930s and it was one of the final works of Yeats."A copy of the first edition print of this book, âThe Ten Principal Upanishads' published by M/s Faber and Faber Ltd of London and printed at the University Press Glasgow has been gifted to President Biden," they said.Modi also gifted a 7.5-carat lab-grown green diamond to First Lady Jill Biden. The diamond, which has been made in India, reflects earth-mined diamonds' chemical and optical properties and is also eco-friendly, as eco-diversified resources like solar and wind power were used in its making."It is a beacon of responsible luxury that symbolises India's 75 years of freedom and sustainable International relations," officials said.US President Biden and First Lady Jill presented a handmade, antique American book galley from the early 20th Century as the official gift to Prime Minister Modi.They also reportedly gifted a vintage American camera, accompanied by an archival facsimile print of George Eastman's Patent of the first Kodak camera, a hardcover book on American wildlife photography, and a signed, first edition copy of 'Collected Poems of Robert Frost'.Modi arrived in Washington from New York where he led a historic event at the UN headquarters earlier in the day to commemorate the 9th International Day of Yoga, attended by UN officials, diplomats and prominent personalities.He is on a three-day official State visit to the US at the invitation of President Biden and the first lady.</dd><dt>TMC calls Patna opposition meet 'good beginning' ahead of 2024 Lok Sabha polls</dt><dd>KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress (TMC) considers Friday's opposition meeting in Bihar's Patna as a "good beginning" ahead of the 2024 general elections and emphasised the significance of anti-BJP parties uniting against "undemocratic and authoritarian policies".Leaders as diverse as Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, MK Stalin, Sharad Pawar, Mehbooba Mufti and Hemant Soren and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal are expected to take part in the meeting convened by Bihar chief minister and JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar, who dumped the BJP last year.Banerjee will be accompanied by TMC national general secretary and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee for the opposition meeting."A good beginning even before reaching Patna ... All parties working to save the Constitution of the country are on the same page on many issues. For now, we have a date, a venue and an agreement that the head of every party will attend the meeting."Subsequently, the date and venue for the next meeting will be decided in Patna. Beyond this, it is not advisable for anyone to jump the gun and speculate," TMC's Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien said.The idea of hosting a meeting of opposition leaders in Patna was floated by Banerjee, who had invoked the memory of Jayaprakash Narayan upon meeting Kumar in Kolkata in April.The aim should be to ensure that the opposition unity takes shape at the earliest as less than a year is left before the 2024 general elections, Senior TMC leader Sukhendu Shekhar Roy told PTI."The BJP has destroyed the country's democracy and is trying to subvert the Constitution. If the parties, which are opposed to the BJP and are fighting against it, fail to come together to put up a united fight, it would be unfortunate for the country," he said.Roy said the efforts to cobble up opposition unity had begun last year during the selection of opposition candidates for the presidential elections.When asked whether the issue of leadership of the opposition front would throw a spanner into the efforts, Roy said, "Only media and BJP are bothered about it. Neither the opposition parties nor the people of this country are bothered about such a leadership issue."Another TMC leader, who did not wish to be named, said the ongoing crisis in Manipur, where ethnic violence has claimed over 100 lives, would also feature in the discussions.After the Congress' massive victory in the Karnataka polls earlier this month, the TMC supremo had said her party would support the grand old party where it is strong in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections but had asserted that she would expect a seat-sharing formula to give priority to regional players in areas where they were strong.Kumar, the JD(U) 's supreme leader, has been pitching for "opposition unity" ever since he snapped ties with the BJP in August last year.The BJP dubbed the proposed opposition meeting a 'futile exercise' and said such an 'opportunistic alliance would not yield any result'."These are futile exercises. We saw such efforts in 2014 and 2019, and the results are before us. The people of this country trust the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They would never vote for an unstable and opportunistic alliance," BJP's West Bengal unit president Sukanta Majumdar said.</dd><dt>Manipur violence over 50 days has wounded India’s conscience, says Sonia Gandhi</dt><dd>NEW DELHI: Congress leader Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday issued an appeal for peace to the people of Manipur, and urged the women to lead the way in restoring normalcy.

He appreciated ongoing bilateral academic exchanges, and collaborations between Indian and US academic and research ecosystems."I am really happy to have got an opportunity to interact with young and creative minds here. India is working on several projects in collaboration with the NSF. I thank First Lady Jill Biden for planning and organising this event," Modi said.Explaining the skilling mission of his government, Modi said for the bright future of youngsters, it is important to have education, skill and innovation, and India has worked in this direction.The National Education Policy (NEP), education and skilling have been integrated.Under the Skilling Mission, more than 50 million people have been trained, and another 15 million are being given training on latest and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchains, Modi said while addressing a gathering.To maintain the momentum of growth, "for India and the US, it is important to ensure a pipeline of talent", he said and added that his goal is to have this decade as "techdecade".The US has the world's top educational institutions and advanced technologies, while India the world's biggest "yuva (youth) factory", the prime minister said and added that he believes, the India-US partnership will prove to be the sustainable and inclusive engine for global growth.Later in a tweet, Modi said, "Honoured that @FLOTUS @DrBiden joined us in a special event relating to skill development.
